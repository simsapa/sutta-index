## Helpful types of feedback

- **Incorrect citations.** The sutta linked to doesn't seem to be related at all to keyword.
- **"I was looking for X topic and couldn't find anything."**
- **"I was expecting X topic to be listed under Z heading and it wasn't."**
- **Lists of _non-obvious_ keywords** you would hope to see in an index that are not included yet.

## Not so helpful feedback at this point

- **Inconsistencies.** Currently the index is in draft form and inconsistencies will be resolved later.
- **Missing index items for books not yet indexed** (see list of indexed books above)
- **"Sutta X is indexed but the identical sutta Y is not indexed."** Not all suttas will be included in the index. If there is a significant reason why a particular sutta not indexed should be, that's fine feedback, though.
