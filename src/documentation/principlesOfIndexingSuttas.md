# Principles of indexing suttas

- If someone were looking for this spot, what keywords would they check?"
- If good quality and bad quality appear side by side, sometimes it is enough to index on one of them
- It is not necessary to index every occurance of a stock passage unless 1) it is in a unique or significant context or 2) it is the first occurance in a nikaya. This means it is acceptable to have a stock passage indexed 4 times, one for each nikaya.
- The index should draw a person in and excite their curiosity.
- An otherwise insignificant mention of a topic _outside_ of a stock passage that is usually treated in a stock passage should be indexed."
- While creating, focus more on collecting than sorting
- Regarding English keywords with parenthetical Pali: subheads may not necessarily include the specific Pali word in keyword.
