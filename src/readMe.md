# Principles of indexing suttas

"If someone were looking for this spot, what keywords would they check"

"If good quality and bad quality appear side by side, sometimes it is enough to index on one of them"

"It is not necessary to index every occurance of a stock passage unless 1) it is in a unique or significant context or 2) it is the first occurance in a nikaya. This means it is acceptable to have a stock passage indexed 4 times, one for each nikaya."

"Key on the coloquial version of an idea and cross reffrence to more technical terms, e.g. key on lying and cross ref to false speech."

"The index should draw a person in and excite their curiosity."

"An otherwise insignificant mention of a topic _outside_ of a stock passage that is usually treated in a stock passage should be indexed."

While creating, focus mor on collecting than sorting
