# Sutta Index Project

This sutta index is still very much a work in progress. You can find a demo of the data [here](https://index.readingfaithfully.org/).

If you would like to offer feedback, please see [this page in the documentation](https://github.com/thesunshade/sutta-index/blob/main/src/documentation/helpfulFeedback.md#offering-feedback).

Curious about the philosopy being used to create the index? See [these notes](https://github.com/thesunshade/sutta-index/blob/main/src/documentation/principlesOfIndexingSuttas.md#principles-of-indexing-suttas).
